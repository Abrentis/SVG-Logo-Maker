# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

As a developer, I create many projects and applications. Although I am very capable of putting a name on a project to signify that it is mine, I want more flare out of my stamp. I was inspired to create a logo maker that will fulfill this desire. It will make my name stand out even more, and it's a convenient way to whip up different logos at a moment's notice. From working on this project, I learned how useful it can be writing code in SVG to help make visual designs.
